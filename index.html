        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My favorite hobby is baking. I love trying out new recipes for cakes, cookies, cake pops and cupcakes. Baking is a great way to relax and have fun! I always make everyone super happy when I bake something. For my mom's birthday I made a chocolate and sponge cake. (It was super, super, yummy!)</p>

        <p>You can always make whatever you want and when it comes out of the oven, you can eat something you made yourself and delicious! Give it a try!</p>
